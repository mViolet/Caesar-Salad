# Caesar: A Simple Encryption Program #

<p>This is my solution to "Caesar" in Problem Set 2 of CS50.</p>
<p>It's a simple encryption program (in C) which takes a key in the form of a single command line argument & then prompts for a message... which is later converted into a secret message!
The requirements for this task were:</p>

## To use the program: ##
- Run `./caesar [key]`, where [key] is any positive integer. This will be the encryption key.<br>
- At the next prompt, Provide a message to encrypt.
- Hit Enter & your encrypted message will appear!</p>
