# Caesar: A Simple Encryption Program #

<p>This is my solution to "Caesar" in Problem Set 2 of CS50.</p>
<p>It's a simple encryption program (in C) which takes a key in the form of a single command line argument & then prompts for a message... which is later converted into a secret message!
</p>

## To use the program in a [CS50 Sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/cecff2d8-b49a-495a-94c0-2051917e0e83): ##
- In the command line window, type `./caesar [key]`, where [key] is any positive integer. This will be the encryption key.<br>
- At the next prompt, Provide a message to encrypt.
- Hit Enter & your encrypted message will appear!</p>

Why is the repo called "Caesar Salad", you ask? Well, I just really like Caesar salad. ...And I'm hungry!
